# Emi's User Scripts (Because the Internet Needs More Fixing)

Welcome to my humble collection of JavaScript duct tape. These are Tampermonkey scripts, designed to *enhance* (or, let's be honest, *fix*) your browsing experience â€” because apparently, billion-dollar corporations can't be bothered to make their websites usable.

## Installation

You'll need a user script manager like Tampermonkey.

## The Scripts

- **GitHub Forklore Explorer:** Displays a list of forks at the top of the current repo's main page. You can sort them, you can search for commit messages... you can finally give a middle finger to GitHub's *primitive* fork navigation.

- **GitHub's Rainbow Time Machine**: colorizes commit messages by date, allowing you to quickly glance at how active a repo is and how old are its commits

- **Udio Song Settings**: extracts the hidden generation settings from Udio songs. Udio likes to keep secrets, I like to expose them. Now you can see exactly what parameters were used to create that audio masterpiece (or trainwreck).

- **AliExpress Noise Canceller:** improves AliExpress search results by getting rid of the useless products that clog up your screen. You know, the ones that have *absolutely nothing* to do with what you actually searched for.

## Contributing

If, for some inexplicable reason, you find these scripts useful and want to improve them (or fix the inevitable bugs), feel free to submit a pull request.  Just don't expect me to be overly enthusiastic about it.  I'm mostly doing this to precisely avoid having to work.
