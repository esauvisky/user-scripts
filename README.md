# Emi's User Scripts (Because the Internet Needs More Fixing)

Welcome to my humble collection of JavaScript duct tape. These are Tampermonkey scripts, designed to *enhance* (or, let's be honest, *fix*) your browsing experience â€” because apparently, billion-dollar corporations can't be bothered to make their websites usable.

## Installation

You'll need a user script manager like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

## The Scripts

### Forklore Explore
- **Description:** Displays a sortable, searchable list of forks right at the top of a GitHub repo's main page. You can sort them, you can search commit messages... you can finally give a middle finger to GitHub's *primitive* fork navigation.
- **File:** [scripts/github-forklore-explore.js](scripts/github-forklore-explore.js)
- **Preview:**
  ![forklore](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bed89c4-ffb8-466d-b15d-9e681d6a50fb)

### Checkout My Colors
- **Description:** Adds a cool color gradient to commit timestamps on GitHub file listings, based on their date. You can instantly spot if a repo is active or basically dead.
- **File:** [scripts/github-checkout-my-colors.js](scripts/github-checkout-my-colors.js)
- **Preview:**
  ![colorizer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c257be0-f4da-4390-90aa-c2b4272b0da5)

### Udio Secret Spiller
- **Description:** Extracts the hidden generation settings from Udio songs. Udio likes to keep secrets, I like to expose them.
- **File:** [scripts/udio-song-settings.js](scripts/udio-song-settings.js)

### AliExpress Junk Zapper
- **Description:** Improves AliExpress search results by getting rid of the useless products that clog up your screen. You know, the ones that have *absolutely nothing* to do with what you actually searched for.
- **File:** [scripts/aliexpress-noise-canceller.js](scripts/aliexpress-noise-canceller.js)

## Contributing

If, for some inexplicable reason, you find these scripts useful and want to improve them (or fix the inevitable bugs), feel free to submit a pull request. Just don't expect me to be overly enthusiastic about it. I'm mostly doing this to precisely avoid having to work.
